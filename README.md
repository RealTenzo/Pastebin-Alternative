### 3. **Validate Markdown Formatting**
Ensure that the Markdown structure is correct overall. For example, ensure headings are correctly formatted (using `#`), lists are properly indented with hyphens (`-`), and code blocks are wrapped with triple backticks (```).

### 4. **GitHub Render Issue**
Sometimes, rendering issues can occur if there is a mistake elsewhere in the file, but GitHub's Markdown renderer is unable to interpret it. Check the file for any misplaced characters, like unescaped backticks, or stray `-`, `:`, or `#` symbols outside their proper contexts.

### Example of Correctly Formatted `README.md`:
